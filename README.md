Introduction

My name is shreyansh agarwal and I am a 19-year-old university student with a deep passion for blockchain technology. I have been actively involved in the Algorand blockchain ecosystem, contributing to various projects and initiatives. My journey into the blockchain realm began with Solidity, where I gained hands-on experience in developing smart contracts. Now, I am thrilled to embark on a new adventure with Move, the programming language for Aptos, a next-generation blockchain platform.
